Where, and how often will you meet while working?

Very seldom in person.


How do you communicate in the group - what channels? - when?

Whatapp. At least every 3 days. But try to communicate if ever stuck for longer the expected.


How will you use version control (git) and other tools you might agree on, like Trello or OverLeaf?

Overleaf for rapport, github to store the the code. 


How do you coordinate the final hand-in?

Communicate when all parts are ready.


How do you ensure everyone knows what they should do after their current task, and what everyone else is working on?

See what we have set as next step / just ask what others are going to need to fully implement their task.


Dealing with Surprises

Tell the group something planned do not actually work in practise. Adjust step plan. Estimated time for project in lenient so this works.


Communication in a group is very important, and at the same time often turns out to be very difficult, especially if something unexpected happens. Discuss at least the following:

What should you do if somebody feels left outside?

Find where they feel left out and try to make sure they have a task to do within that subject.



What should you do if someone gets stuck on their current task?

If simple logical error. Discuss with group members. Else, maybe come back to it later or have somebody else try to complete it.



What happens if someone feels another person isnâ€™t doing their fair share?

Address them and ask if they could refocus on the releavant part of the project. Or if they could do something else to pull the project forward.



What happens if someone is not communicating in the manner or frequency agreed upon?

Ask the person for a reason why they are not communcating in the expected time. Do they have something else they are doing right now.
